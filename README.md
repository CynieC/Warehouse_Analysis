## Introduction

The warehouse analysis is a two-page report that looks into both the customer care calls received by the warehouse as well as the customer reviews. The customer care calls look at factors like customer rating, weight in grams, gender, warehouse block and product importance. Similarly, the customer rating analysis looks at different factors such as gender, mode of shipment, warehouse block and customer care calls. The customer rating analysis provides insights into the ratings received by the warehouse from clients.
